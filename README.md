# mastermind
To run the tests, type `rake test` in the command line.
To play mastermind, type `rake play`. 

Notes: 
When running the files, I didnt understand why if I ran them straight from the command line or sublime, I 
had to have `require '../lib/file'` but to run the tests or code using rake I had to change it to `require './lib/file'`
